# ISRCP
This project is Integrity Solutions' Recursive Code Printer (ISRCP). This is a little project to recursively print the source code files for your project.

## No More Single File Printing
The reason behind this project is that, here at Integrity Solutions, we develop our software in the NetBeans IDE. It is truly an awesome and powerful IDE for developing software, but, when we complete a project to a release point, we have to, currently, print each file, one at a time, so that we can take care of our copyrighting. This just gets old.

## The Solution
We feel that the solution to this problem is to simply create a little program that will recursively walk a project's source tree and print all the source files out in one fail swoop. This way, we can be sure we don't miss printing out a file when we submit our source for copyrighting. As everyone knows, copyrights are important for developers to protect their intellectual property. Even though we work in the Open Source world, we still need to copyright our code, so that it remains ours in the future. This is why every single Open Source license mentions that, though you can redistribute and modify the source code, the original copyright notice **must** stay in tact. Therefore, we need to make sure we copyright our work. And, the first step toward the copyright is to print the source code out. Why not make that step as hassle-free as possible? Especially since the rest of the copyright process is chock full of hoops and hassles!
